*Being able to deploy your machine learning model is an absolute necessity. Whether you're building a model or generating reports, you need this skill.  It takes that model that you poured your blood, sweat, and tears into and turns it into something that absolutely anyone can play with and admire.*

This project utilizes Python, PyTorch, Flask, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, HTML, CSS, JSON, Gunicorn, Pillow, and more.
